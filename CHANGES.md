# StreamEx changes

### 0.3.5

* Generic arguments relaxed for `StreamEx` methods: `forPairs`, `collapse`, `groupRuns`, `intervalMap`, `sortedBy`.
* Added `MoreCollectors.minIndex/maxIndex` collectors.

### 0.3.4

* Fixed: `EntryStream.of(List<T>)`, `EntryStream.of(T[])` and `StreamEx.runLengths` returned stream
of `Map.Entry` objects which violate the documented contract for `equals` and `hashCode`.
* Fixed: `pairMap` method for all streams worked incorrectly when previous steps included `parallel().flatMap()` due to JDK bug. New version may also work faster in parallel for certain sources.
* Fixed: `collapse`-based methods (`collapse`, `groupRuns`, `runLengths`, `intervalMap`) worked incorrectly in various cases in parallel mode. New version may also work faster in parallel for certain sources.
* Fixed: `minBy*/maxBy*` for primitive streams now return strictly the first matched element (not the arbitrary one). 
* Optimized: `minBy/maxBy` methods for primitive streams now call keyExtractor function at most once per element
* Optimized: many stream creation methods (`zip` for all streams, `EntryStream.of(List)`, `StreamEx.ofSubLists`, etc.) now use custom spliterator.
* Optimized: `IntStreamEx.ofChars` reimplemented for JDK 8 as original `CharSequence.chars` implementation is poor.
* Added construction of all stream types from the `Spliterator`.
* Updated documentation

### 0.3.3

* Added `StreamEx.intervalMap` method
* Added `StreamEx.runLengths` method
* Added `StreamEx.ofSubLists` method
* Added `MoreCollectors.countingInt` collector
* `StreamEx/EntryStream.maxBy*/minBy*` methods optimized: now keyExtractor function is called at most once per element
* `StreamEx.groupRuns` method optimized (up to 5x performance boost depending on data)
* `StreamEx.collapse` methods changed: now the elements passed to the predicate are guaranteed to be two adjacent elements from the source stream.
* Updated documentation: now documentation is automatically copied from JDK for the inherited methods.

* Added `greater`/`less`/`atLeast`/`atMost` filter methods for primitive streams
* Updated documentation

### 0.2.2
